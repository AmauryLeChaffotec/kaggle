    "# Step 1: Browse the competition tabs\n",
    "In this step, you’ll learn how to work with the competition page to answer many important questions you might have.   \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several tabs below the header, including: Overview, Data, Code, Discussion, Leaderboard, and Rules (along with Team, once you accept the competition rules).  \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/hguZ5w7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll step through each tab individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "When you first navigate to any competition page, you will be on the Overview tab.  This tab is good to read first, and it can include important information like:\n",
    "- A high-level description of the data and how you’ll use it in the competition,\n",
    "- How submissions will be evaluated and ranked, \n",
    "- Important dates (like when the competition started, the deadline for accepting the competition rules, and the final submission deadline), and\n",
    "- Prizes the top winners will receive (usually cash or Kaggle merchandise).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "The Data tab is where you can download the competition data.  You’ll also learn more about the data in more detail than was covered in the Overview tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of the information here is hidden until after you accept the competition rules.  You’ll accept the rules in Step 2, and then we’ll revisit the Data tab in Step 3 of this guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code\n",
    "You can use the Code tab to view code that other Kagglers have written to analyze the competition data. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to use the code here to guide your own investigations.   All of the notebooks that appear here have been shared with the entire community, in the hope that many people can learn from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "When viewing a notebook, you can use the “Copy and Edit” button to create your own, private notebook (only you can see it).  If you edit the code, you’re only editing your copy, and it won’t change the original notebook.  In order to make the notebooks that you write appear in the Code tab for the rest of the community, you’ll need to change the notebook settings to make the notebook public.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you find a notebook useful, you should thank the author by giving the notebook an upvote.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the tab to write your own notebooks to work with the data, through the “New Notebook” button. (If you click on this now and have not yet accepted the competition rules, you’ll first be prompted to read and accept the rules.)\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/CD8DRYq.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in this guide, you’ll learn in more detail how to use the Code section to guide your learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion\n",
    "Use this tab to discuss the competition with other Kagglers.  There are three options for discussing the competition. You can:\n",
    "- Chat with the entire Kaggle community by making a post in the Discussion tab, or\n",
    "- Join a team and share your insights with all of your teammates, or\n",
    "- Keep the information to yourself.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You should especially avoid privately sharing information with only a small group of people who aren’t on a team with you (for instance, in a private Slack or Discord channel) - this is considered cheating.  In other words, in order to discuss the competition in a small group, you’ll must join a team with them.  You’ll learn more about how to do this in Step 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Leaderboard\n",
    "You’ll use the Leaderboard to see where your submissions rank against other Kagglers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you submit competition predictions, the website checks how close your predictions are to the test set’s true values, according to the competition’s metric.  As an example, consider a hypothetical competition where the metric is root mean squared error (RMSE).  Submissions that get lower RMSE are assigned a higher ranking on the leaderboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the Leaderboard page, there are two tabs: Public Leaderboard and Private Leaderboard.  This is because only a subset of your predictions are used to assign a spot on the Public Leaderboard, and the rest are used to assign a spot on the Private Leaderboard.  Which rows are used for which leaderboards are kept secret, and the Private Leaderboard is kept hidden from all competitors until after the competition concludes.  The Private Leaderboard is the “real” leaderboard that is used to decide the final rankings, and it decides who receives competition prizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/eRxlQtD.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering: Why does Kaggle have two leaderboards?  This is to dissuade [overfitting](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/underfitting-and-overfitting) to the Public Leaderboard.   Unlike the Public Leaderboard, the Private Leaderboard is truly unseen, and it provides a good indication of whether or not your model will generalize well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules\n",
    "You must accept the rules in order to participate.  The rules govern how many submissions you can make per day, the maximum team size, and other competition-specific details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to take a quick look at this now.  You’ll take a closer look at this tab in the next step, when you join the competition."

    "- __Section A1. Winner License__, which grants the competition sponsor a license for your submission, if you are a competition winner.  *For instance, the code used to generate the winning submission to the [BirdCLEF 2021 - Birdcall Identification competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/birdclef-2021/rules) will have an open source Initiative-approved license.*\n",

    "The way you submit to the competition will vary with the type of competition.  In this guide, we’ll talk about how to submit to a **Prediction** competition, which is the most common competition type. It’s also the type of competition you’ll participate in as part of the 30 Days of ML program.  The other types of competitions are **Code** competitions (which you can read about [here](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/competitions#notebooks-only-competitions)) and **Simulation** competitions (which you can see an example of [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx)).\n",

    "Often, some blockers for getting started with a new competition can involve:\n",
    "- figuring out how to access the data within your coding environment, and\n",
    "- determining how to structure a submission in the format that is expected by the competition.\n",
    " \n",

    "If you use another Kaggler’s notebook to make a submission, it’s good practice to take time to understand any code that you plan to use, and to show your thanks by upvoting the notebook.  If you use someone else’s code (or ideas) in your own notebook, you should carefully cite their contribution.  "
